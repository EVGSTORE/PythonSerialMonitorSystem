# PythonSerialMonitorSystem
This custom, yet underkill overkill app lets you select active com ports and send and watch commands from them. It also has a built in audio file for NSL airsoft sounds

This Python system contains:
* Dropdown Com port menu 
* Interface to see the most recent command recived
* Textbox to send command to com port (also sends command back into the script virtually)
* Built-in 5 audio files (horn, buzzer, feet, weapon, and endgame) for NSL airsoft sound effects.
* Code for Arduino
